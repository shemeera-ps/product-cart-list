This is a simple restaurant product page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a modern CSS Grid layout with a fully responsive design. The page allows users to browse products, add or remove items from the cart, view the total item count, individual item totals, and grand total. An order confirmation popup appears upon checkout, enhancing the user experience.

This project is a practice exercise for implementing dynamic cart functionality, modern UI styling, and interactive JavaScript features. ðŸš€
